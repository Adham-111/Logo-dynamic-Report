**project goal**



The goal of this Power BI project is to provide a comprehensive and interactive overview of LEGO sets across various themes, categories, and age groups. It helps users explore key metrics such as total number of sets, average price, and average piece count.
Through dynamic filters, detailed breakdowns, and visual storytelling, the dashboard enables users to:

Analyze set trends by theme and subtheme

Compare pricing and piece count across age ranges

Identify valuable or rare sets (e.g., high-priced Star Wars sets)

This dashboard is ideal for collectors, retailers, or analysts seeking insights into LEGO set distributions, market value, and design complexity.
